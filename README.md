Live Chat using Flask Socket io

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
This is a real time live chat.
A layout template has been created which then gets extended by other tmeplates.
Upon reaching the server the user,if not logged in,gets taken to the login part.
The user can create or join (if the channels are displayed) any channels they want.
And the user has also the feature to delete any messages he/she has sent.
